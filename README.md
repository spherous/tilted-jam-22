# tilted-jam-22

https://spherous.itch.io/space for the submission build

For this game jam, we are to make a game based off of a MadLibs randomly built at the beginning of the jam.

One day I will visit space. I will build a rocketship that looks like a Fierce Dinosaur(noun-thing). I will Count Down(verb-your choice) before blasting off in the rocketship. 
I will go past the Tesla(nound-thing) and the clouds(noun-thing) in the sky. I will land on the moon. I will meet an alien named Bacon(noun-name). 
The alien will teach me how to Fly(verb) and Shoot(verb) on the moon. 
I will say goodbye to the alien and teleport(verb) back to the rocketship. When I get back to Earth(noun-place), I will see that the alien has given me a Pizza(noun-thing) as a going-away present. 
I will happily Eat(verb) before going to bed that night.
